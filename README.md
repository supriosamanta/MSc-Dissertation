# MR Fluid Based Haptic Feedback System

This repository hosts the MSc Robotics dissertation project by **Samanta Suprio Sujoy** from the University of Sheffield.

## 📄 Abstract
This project explores the development of a wearable haptic feedback system using Magnetorheological (MR) fluid. The system generates both **normal and lateral forces** using MR fluid's field-dependent viscosity characteristics. A silicone-based device and peristaltic pump controlled by an Arduino and electromagnet were designed and tested to simulate cutaneous feedback for a user's index finger.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The project involved the design and fabrication of a silicone rubber-based wearable haptic device with hollow internal channels filled with MR fluid. Key steps included:

- Designing 3D molds for casting the top and bottom silicone layers.
- Using a peristaltic pump to circulate MR fluid.
- Activating the MR fluid using an electromagnet to create shear and normal forces.
- Controlling the entire system using an Arduino and relay circuit.

The fluid flow and viscosity control are modeled using:
- **Hagen–Poiseuille law** (for Newtonian behavior under no magnetic field)
- **Herschel–Bulkley model** (for post-yield, non-Newtonian behavior under magnetic activation)

## 🧪 Experimental Setup

A 6-axis load cell sensor was used to measure the forces and torques generated by the haptic device. The setup included:

- The wearable haptic device mounted on the sensor.
- Electromagnet positioned near the device.
- Peristaltic pump circulating MR fluid.
- Arduino controlling activation timing and relay logic.

## 📊 Results

- The system generated **normal forces averaging 0.4 N**.
- **Shear forces** produced torques up to **0.5 Nm in X** and **2 Nm in Y** axes.
- The response was immediate upon electromagnet activation.
- Higher activation frequencies improved feedback consistency.
- Successful integration with a Franka Emika gripper using an FSR sensor for reactive pulse generation.
